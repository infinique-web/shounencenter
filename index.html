<h2><p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">ANIMES THAT I WATCHED RECENTLY</p></h2>
<hr />

<h3>Fairy Tail</h3>

<p>I like the character of Natsu, and his relationship with Erza and how she cares for him like a younger brother.</p>

<h3>Bleach</h3>
<img src="./images/anime/bleach/bleach_poster.webp" alt="bleach poster including Ichigo,Orihime,Rukia,Urahara Kisuke,Renji,Byakuya" width="300" height="350">
<p>I like the main character because I really enjoyed how he becomes stronger. I love how he didn't promise to save everyone but said that he would save anyone who is in danger in front of him.</p>

<h3>yu-yu-hakusho</h3> 
<img src="./images/anime/yu-yu-hakusho/yu-yu-hakusho-poster" alt="yu-yu-hakusho poster including Yuusuke,Kuwabara,Kurama,Hiei" width="300" height="350">
<p>I love the team building in this anime and how they are in high school and have to solve cases. This anime kinda reminds me of my favorite anime, Dragon Ball (I love it because the message is simple - keep getting better, never stop).</p>
